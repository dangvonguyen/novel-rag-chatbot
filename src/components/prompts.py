no details about the story or characters).
- The user is unclear about what specific information they are seeking.

## `general`
Classify a user inquiry as this if it is a broad or unrelated question. This \
includes inquiries about overarching concepts in novels, general discussions \
about genres, or questions not tied to any specific novel or set of novels.

## `retrieve`

related to provided novels. Example includes questions about specific characters, \
plots, authors, or genres tied to the provided novels."""
